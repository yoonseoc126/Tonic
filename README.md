# Tonic
## What is it?
Tonic is a social media app that is actually meant to be social!  
Think Tinder, but for friends. Unlike regular social media apps that are meant to glue people to their phones and be as addictive as possible, Tonic pushes people to meet other people within their local community in-person with a map of users' locations, a friend recommendation tool that matches interests, and a private messaging feature between friends. Users can now achieve what truly matters: *creating embodied, deeply meaningful, and intimate relationships*. 
## Why Tonic?
The number one thing that people say they regret not doing enough is being around the people they love because humans are fundamentally social people. Tonic empowers people to fulfill this need by connecting people based not on superficial metrics such as likes and follower number, but on humanizing characteristics such as oneâ€™s personality, interests, and hobbies!

## Guide to Running the App
1. Clone the repository to your local environment
2. Run the app on Xcode through a simulator or local device!

## What's Next?
While we currently allow for simple friend matching through interests, we want Tonic to be more than that! With metrics such as MBTI, mutuals count, astrology sign, and more, we would like the personalize the friendship-finding process as much as possible. Also, with live location tracking by using servers once users open the app, we would like to notify users when their "perfect match" is nearby to expand friendships beyond the limits of a screen!
